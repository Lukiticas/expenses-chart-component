## Overview

Great project, had lot's of fun doing it and learned a lot of things too! A tried to make it as semantic as possible.
I will soon try to make an option to submit your own week charts, like an pop up or alike.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart
